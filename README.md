# Sudoku Solver

Gonna give [this puzzle](https://cracking-the-cryptic.web.app/sudoku/36r8R9FNnN) a try.

## Rules

Standard sudoku rules apply. Furthermore, numbers in every cage must add up to a perfect square.

## Results

The C++ version generated a solution in slightly less than 24 hours. The JavaScript version cannot produce a solution within a reasonable timeframe, unless a significant proportion of cages are removed.
